High score is counted from amount of hits taken and hits successfully deflected into the witch; as well as retries by square

First level (it's an easy level, so each hit counts):
--Score + (Hits you give * 100)
--Score - (Hits you take * 70)

Second level (moderate level):
--Score + (Hits you give * 50)
--Score - (Hits you take * 25)

Third level (dakka level, so individual hits don't mean as much):
--Score + (Hits you give * 30)
--Score - (Hits you take * 12)

Each retry costs 500 points, but the amount of retries is in square
--Score - (Retries * Retries * 500)
