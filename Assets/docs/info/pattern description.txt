===First Battle===
Easiest pattern. Codename is DIFFERENTIATING (not random, that would be hard)
Logic:
1. (done) Attack with direct hits, 5 slow hits.
2. (done) Attack in half-arc, 4 slow hits.
3. (done) Attack in arc, 3 slow hits.
4. (done) Wait a second
5. (done) Explosion (three arc hits)
6. (done) Wait a couple of seconds, and repeat
