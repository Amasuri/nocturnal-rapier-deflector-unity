------------NOW----------------

--First battle 1:30 -> 1:00; second battle as well
--Endgame screen
--High score system from the original

-----------LATER----------------


--Update Sprites once you get all the new ones. Try to just replace the actual assets under same name, so no setting the same things again. You'll also have to update resolution by scale and new BG dimension.

--Maybe add some visual / sound to mouse limiter?

--Title screen (language and high score)!!!!
