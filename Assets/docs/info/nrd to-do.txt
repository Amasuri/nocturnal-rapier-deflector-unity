------------DO IT NOW----------------

--Switch to PC / HTML5 build and wrap it up there. I suspect you'll have to change some compression settings on sprites
----(Done) You can also slightly modify the mobile tutorial to have W instead of tap animation (otherwise the same)
----(Done) Fill out the page & ready to pre-publish. Should be easy since it's not Google Play and you've done it many times
----(Done) When you release on Itch, update links in the profile and on old game page AND
----(Done) Also update the Youtube trailer link to the new itch.io version. And have itch io ver have the trailer
----(Done) Upload & Debug HTML5 version on itch
----(Done) Upload & Debug PC version on itch
----(Done) If you finish HTML5 version, mention it in Youtube description (done), Itch (done) and Twitter (done)!
----(Done) Tag "@itchio ? :)" (they support it!) in replies to the release page!
----Make repo public at https://github.com/Amasuri can also add "you can compile it, here's the source code" in itch
----(Done) Release?

--Actually publish it on Google Play lol!
----(Done) Upload the updated AAB package
----(Done) Silently release the itch version before the Google one (it'll be easier to sync)
----(Done) Once you wrap up with setting up both for Free and Paid versions, actually publish!
----Check if "Early Access" is gone from store page after a few hours
----Don't forget to make Youtube video public (and include links) + make a Twitter & VK (amasuri) announcement!
----Make a #NRDscore first post && Twitter incentive post (like "hey!") so that people'd post it too!
----If Klaas agrees to made a video, give him a link! ;)

-----------IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO WASTE TIME----------------

--Okay, turns out in some cases the score points get confusing, so if you're looking to waste time, make a score tutorial: Highlight low part of the screen (same way you do l/r highlight of controls), but explicitly say that left is how many times you hit the witch, and right is how many times the witch has hit you

--Try to find a way to dynamically widen the dialogue pop-ups on the mobile. They look good on PC, but these edges on mobile.... (okay, this worked finely on PC, but turned out to be way harder than it seemed on mobile)

--Some sound / visual when sword moves too quickly...
----Sword "heating" or fainting
----The main issue is not in effect, but how to count for quick moving; as there's no way to tell for limits of unity collision. So you'll have to experiment with it. Also refer to World Units and not pixels, because they're different from device to device
----Actually there's an effect issue too. Heating up idk (might be hard to make it look pretty), but if it'll be fainting or blickering, it'll add some confusion cuz you also have the wall effect as that. Plus idk how will it look, typically "too fast" movements are very rapid, under 0.4s, not sure if the user will notice especially if it's on mobile where there's a possibility of rapier being underneath the finger. All in all not sure if it'll work well in it's intended function of telling the user they moved too quickly. It barely happens on mobile anyway + on PC idk? Also it makes me feel like there'd be too many rapier effects at this point which is slightly distractive from the gameplay. The wall effect already somewhat is. I'll just shove it into "waste of time" category unless I envision a good solution

--Ползунок звука и музыки? Без понятия, где его запилить, меню только под это делать не очень...

--Странный баг, при котором обрезается последняя фраза если стоит >= макс длины, но лупится текст при >. Пока что решён костыльно присоединением пустой фразы к тексту

--Maaaaaaaaaybe add Rewarded Ad to retry screen? Like, you can only retry if you watch it (only in Free version of course)
----The problem here is as with title screen ads: some countries may not support ads (eg Russia) && coding the engine for "try load ads for 10 seconds, but if failed, do it automatically" is a bit of a pain cuz there's no way to make gameplay smooth enough so that in worst case user won't have to wait. There's not enough API in Unity ads to check for .IsCountryAdSupported and .IsAdTypeSupportedAndShowing (e.g. Unity Mediation Banner is "showing", but in reality it's not supported) and such and such; so the workaround would always be to implement some kinda delay to have a middle ground between all the cases
